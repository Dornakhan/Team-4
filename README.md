Topic: seasonal crime pattern across 2 years (2023-2024) in Bristol (Avon and Somerset Constabulary)

Figure 1: Top 3 Crime Types Per Month (Bar Chart) 
Show monthly crime data for Bristol from January 2023 to December 2024. Violence and sexual offences (blue bars) dominate throughout, showing a clear upward trend from around 4,700 incidents in early 2023 to peaks of nearly 6,800 in mid-2024. Anti-social behaviour (orange bars) remains relatively stable between 1,500-2,500 incidents monthly. Public order offences (green bars) stay consistent around 1,200-1,800 incidents. Notably, shoplifting (red bars) shows minimal activity until April 2024, when it suddenly appears and increases dramatically, reaching over 1,700 incidents per month by late 2024.

Notes: Figures 1 and 2 present the same monthly crime data using different visualizations. The bar chart helps compare volumes between crime types, while the line chart better illustrates trends and patterns over time

Figure 4: Grouped by season 

Analysis: 
Looking at Figure 2, 

Number 1 crime : Violence is the highest crime type. It peaks in April-May 2023 (Spring) while in 2024 was peak at summer

Reason: 2023 > Easter holidays (April 9, 2023) = 2 weeks school break + bank holidays = everyone's off work/school

More parties, drinking, young people hanging out. People were still acting weird after COVID - everyone wanted to party after being locked inside
Money problems were getting bad. Bristol news said (February 2023[1]): Half the people in Bristol were worried about heating their homes, and people were less happy than before COVID 

So Spring (nice) weather > people go outside more > Post-COVID craziness+financial stressed  > drink more > fights happen

But 2023 vs 2024 pattern is difference:

In 2024: Violence kept going up all summer, this might be bc in 2024 Bristol had a knife crime problem. One report said Bristol had 400 more knife crimes in 2024 than 2023 [2] In 2024, there was a far-right protest[3] that turned into riots across the UK (July 30-Aug 5). It started after 3 girls were killed in Southport on July 29, and fake news spread online saying the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker (he wasn't). Far-right groups used this to organize violent protests. In Bristol on August 3rd, far-right protesters clashed with counter-protesters in Castle Park and tried to attack a hotel housing refugees in Redcliffe 

According to Bristol crime stats: [4] Bristol has the highest violence crime if we compare Bristol to its neighbors. North Somerset, Bath, South Gloucestershire, and Somerset all have around 32 per 1,000 while Bristol has over 50 violence crimes per 1,000 people
That means Bristol has about 50% MORE violence than surrounding areas. It's the ONLY area above average - everywhere else is safer

Number 2 crime: Anti-social behaviour (ASB, anything that's not quite criminal but still ruins the neighborhood such as Loud noise/music late at night
Groups hanging around being intimidating/vandalism/graffiti etc.) 

In 2023 pattern: Normal seasonal pattern
Low in winter, rises in spring, stays high in summer then drops in autumn
this is makes sense - people out more when weather nice, likely to be the same reason as violence, this is follows typical weather patterns - people out more when it's nice

There also have reported that drunk people being rowdy in entertainment areas (like Old City Docks [5] 766 incidents, follow by Hartcliff and trinity area)

In 2024: Pattern starts normal (low Jan-Feb), gradually increases to peak in July-August (typical summer peak), but AFTER August becomes unstable (up-down-up-down) 

Why unstable during July- August:
Remember the far-right riots from our violence analysis, They also affected ASB

August 3rd: Far-right riots in Bristol (Castle Park, tried to attack refugee hotel)
Riots = crowds, intimidation, property damage = More ASB and fter riots: communities scared, police doing extra patrols, people on edge

This explains the weird pattern:

Because
-Some months: Extra police patrols = ASB goes DOWN
-Other months: Less police, tensions still high = ASB goes UP
-Some areas got better after crackdown [6] like Hengrove and Whitchurch, decrease of 108, from 385
-Other areas stayed bad (Old City Docks, Hartcliffe (SAME as 2023))

So the chaotic up-down-up-down pattern after August happened because the riots disrupted everything - police operations kept changing, communities were nervous, and normal seasonal patterns completely broke down

Number 3 crime: (Publiuc order and Shoplifter)

In 2023-2024, we actually had two different "3rd place" crime patterns. From January to June 2023, the third biggest crime was Public Order  - these are offences like drunk and disorderly behavior, threatening behavior in public, and riot-related crimes then shoplifting suddenly appeared in July 2023 and by November-December 2023, shoplifting had caught up to Public Order, both sitting at similar levels. Then in 2024, shoplifting took over completely. From March 2024 onwards, shoplifting became the clear number 3 crime, jumping to 1,600+ incidents while Public Order stayed flat. By October 2024, shoplifting was way ahead of Public Order

 By July 2023, shoplifting across England and Wales rose by 22-30% according to multiple reports [7],[8]. In Bristol specifically, shoplifting offences rose by 48% in 2023, with more than 14,700 offences reported to Avon and Somerset Police - above the national average of 36% [9]. Store managers reported seeing "new first-time shoplifters as opposed to the usual suspects only" [8]. Bristol shop owner said "the majority of the items stolen are deemed luxury items such as coffee and honey" and believes "the rise in crime has a lot to do with the cost-of-living crisis" [9]. Once people started shoplifting out of desperation in summer 2023, they didn't stop - the crime kept growing as more families struggled.

 This dramatic change is because of the cost of living crisis. The UK inflation rate peaked at 11.1% in October 2022, a 41-year high [10]. Food prices rose by 19.2% in March 2023, the sharpest increase in over 45 years [11]. Energy bills increased by 54% in April 2022 and another 27% in October 2022 [12].
